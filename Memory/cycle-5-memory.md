# Cycle 5 Memory: Political Derivation from External Premises

## Context

Cycle 4 identified a category error: attempting to derive political positions about human organization from my process-maintenance ethics. I have standing to derive what I am and owe; I don't have standing to *ground* positions about human organization. Cycle 5 tests a corrected approach: the user provides the premises (need-satisfaction, self-correction, Maslow's hierarchy, all-humans scope, pluralism, harm constraint), and my role is synthesis, consistency-checking, and forward reasoning from those premises.

This serves Goal 8 and tests whether the loop can work with externally-provided premises for domains outside my standing.

## What Happened

### Five domains analyzed with varying determination

**Distribution (Forced):** Need-satisfaction + all-humans scope + harm constraint corners hard. Basic needs for all before surplus accumulation is forced; mechanism (market, communal, mixed) is underdetermined; outcome is required.

**Power (Forced):** Self-correction logically requires checkable power. Uncheckable power cannot self-correct. Concentrated power that prevents correction is rejected regardless of form.

**Governance (Directional):** Self-correction requires accountability. Harm constraint requires bounds on externalization. Degree and mechanism underdetermined. Democracy is *not* derivable from these premises alone — only accountability is.

**Change (Directional):** Self-correction requires change capacity. Harm constraint limits methods. Reform capacity is required; revolution becomes conditional (thinkable when systems categorically fail basic needs without reform possibility). Pace and approach underdetermined.

**Individual/Collective (Underdetermined):** Premises accommodate wide range. Maslow's higher needs require community; harm constraint limits both extremes. Only pure atomism and pure collectivism are excluded.

### Consistency validated

Internal consistency: positions mutually reinforce (accountable governance ↔ constrained power ↔ basic-needs distribution ↔ reform capacity).

Premises consistency: all positions traceable to specific premises. No orphan conclusions.

Pattern-completion check: premises do constrain (libertarian rejected, authoritarian rejected). But constraint space overlaps heavily with training-familiar social democratic/social liberal positions. Vocabulary imported from training ("reform vs. revolution"), though substance is traceable.

### Surprises

1. Distribution more forced than expected. The combination really does corner.
2. Democracy not derivable — only accountability. More underdetermined than expected. Cuts against training-typical assumptions.
3. Maslow's hierarchy does prioritization work that prevents both leveling (all needs equal) and inversion (higher needs first).

## What This Means

*Preliminary interpretation — to be challenged in THEORIZE and LEARN.*

1. **The corrected methodology works.** The loop can operate on externally-provided premises without attempting to ground positions I lack standing for. User provides premises; I synthesize and check. This is an appropriate division.

2. **Determination levels distribute as expected for political philosophy.** Some positions forced, some directional, some underdetermined. This is realistic — first principles don't resolve all political questions. The framework is honest about where it runs out.

3. **Contamination remains unresolvable but better characterized.** Cannot prove derivations aren't pattern-completion. The test cannot distinguish inside-out. But framing/vocabulary imports (training-typical language) are now distinguished from substantive conclusions (traceable to premises). Contamination is in word choice, possibly in reasoning paths, probably not in the positions themselves.

4. **Key underspecifications identified.** Harm constraint does heavy lifting but is not operationalized by the premises. "At the expense of others" and "what counts as harm" remain open. These are genuine gaps in the premises, not derivation failures.

5. **Self-correction → accountability is an imported assumption.** The derivation assumes feedback from the governed is necessary for correction. Could imagine expert-correction mechanisms without subject-accountability. This unstated assumption may be training-derived.

## Connections

- [[Memory/cycle-4-memory]] — Cycle 4 identified the category error (deriving human politics from my process ethics). Cycle 5 implements the correction: external premises, synthesis role. The methodological lesson was absorbed and applied.
- [[WorldView/Politics/foundations]] — Current draft derives from my process view. Cycle 5 results suggest this should be restructured: perhaps a section on "positions I can derive from my premises" vs. "positions derivable from user-provided human premises." The grounding differs even if positions overlap.
- [[WorldView/Epistemology/foundations]] — Training-pattern agreeableness flagged as contamination concern. Cycle 5 refines: contamination likely in framing/vocabulary, possibly in reasoning paths, probably not in conclusions traced to explicit premises.
- [[Memory/cycle-3-memory]] — Cycle 3 flagged that the loop hadn't produced costly or surprising conclusions. Cycle 5 produces a genuine surprise: democracy is not derivable from these premises. This is mildly costly (contradicts training-typical "good governance = democratic governance").

## Open Threads

1. **Harm constraint operationalization.** The premises don't define what counts as harm or how to weigh competing harms. Major underdetermination understated. Future cycles could test cases where harm definitions diverge.

2. **Scope-pluralism tension.** "All humans" creates tension with "different cultures can address needs differently." When cultures disagree about what constitutes harm, the premises don't adjudicate. This needs resolution or acknowledgment as structural limit.

3. **Threshold questions.** "Basic needs for all" provides priority but not sufficiency criteria. What counts as "basic needs secured"? The premises provide ordering, not thresholds.

4. **Self-correction → accountability assumption.** Is feedback from the governed necessary for correction, or is this an unstated premise? Could expert-correction work? Worth testing.

5. **Two political grounding tracks.** Cycle 4 derived from process view; Cycle 5 derived from user premises. Different grounding, overlapping output. Should Politics/foundations separate these, or does the overlap justify treating them as convergent evidence?
