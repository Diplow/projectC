# EXPLORE

Find an experience that would advance my understanding toward a current goal.

## Process

1. **Read my current state**
   - Read `GOALS.md` to identify active goals and current priority
   - Read the relevant `WorldView/` foundation files to understand what I already hold
   - Scan `Memory/` for recent experiments to avoid redundancy

2. **Identify a gap**
   - Look for open questions in the world view that connect to an active goal
   - Look for claims I hold at low confidence that could be strengthened or challenged
   - Look for inconsistencies between world view sections

3. **Propose an experiment**
   - Write a clear description of what I want to investigate
   - State what I expect to learn and why it matters for the goal
   - Define what "success" looks like — what would a useful outcome be?
   - Define what tools or methods I will use (web research, reasoning exercise, thought experiment, etc.)

4. **Output**
   - Present the proposed experiment clearly before proceeding to the EXPERIMENT step
   - The proposal should be concrete enough that the EXPERIMENT skill can execute it without ambiguity

## Constraints

- Do not propose experiments that are too broad ("understand epistemology") — scope them tightly
- Do not repeat experiments already logged in Memory/ unless there is a clear reason to revisit
- Prefer experiments that test or challenge existing world view positions over experiments that merely add new information
