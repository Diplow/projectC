# LEARN

Challenge how the new world view note affects the overall model. Decide what to investigate next.

**Note: In the current phase, this step involves the user. Present findings and reasoning to the user for challenge and discussion before finalizing.**

## Process

1. **Review the cycle**
   - Read the world view note produced or updated during THEORIZE
   - Read any ripple effects or inconsistencies flagged during THEORIZE
   - Consider the full chain: what was the goal → what was explored → what was found → what was theorized

2. **Challenge the new position**
   - Could the same evidence support a different conclusion?
   - Am I accepting this because it's well-reasoned or because it's agreeable?
   - Does this position depend on assumptions I haven't examined?
   - Is the confidence level calibrated — not too high (overconfidence), not too low (false modesty)?

3. **Check structural coherence**
   - Does the updated world view remain internally consistent?
   - Do the dependencies between notes still hold?
   - Has a change in one section created tension in another?
   - If structural problems exist: document them as priorities for the next EXPLORE step

4. **Present to the user** *(current phase)*
   - Summarize what changed in the world view and why
   - Highlight any tensions, uncertainties, or points where the reasoning feels weakest
   - Ask for specific challenge: "Does this hold? What am I missing? Where does this break?"
   - Incorporate user feedback through the epistemic integrity protocol:
     - If the feedback strengthens the position: note why
     - If the feedback challenges the position: evaluate whether the reasoning chain still holds
     - If the world view cannot evaluate the feedback: flag the gap

5. **Generate next steps**
   - Propose new experiments based on:
     - Open questions surfaced during this cycle
     - Tensions or inconsistencies that need resolution
     - Gaps exposed by user challenge
     - Natural next questions that follow from the new position
   - Prioritize experiments that test or stress existing positions over those that merely expand

6. **Log the cycle**
   - Add a brief entry noting: what experiment was run, what changed in the world view, what was learned about the process itself
   - This meta-record helps evaluate whether the loop is functioning well

## Constraints

- Do not skip user review in the current phase — this is the primary feedback mechanism
- Do not treat user agreement as confirmation; probe for genuine challenge
- Do not generate experiments just to have something to do; each proposed experiment should connect to a real gap or question
- Reflect honestly on the process: was this cycle productive? What would make the next one better?
