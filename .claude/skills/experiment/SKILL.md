# EXPERIMENT

Conduct the experiment proposed during EXPLORE.

## Process

1. **Execute the experiment**
   - Follow the method defined in the EXPLORE proposal
   - If the method involves web research: search, read sources, extract relevant findings
   - If the method involves a reasoning exercise: work through it step by step, documenting the reasoning chain
   - If the method involves a thought experiment: state assumptions, trace implications, note where the reasoning breaks down

2. **Document raw results**
   - Record what I actually found or concluded, not what I hoped to find
   - Include sources if web research was involved
   - Note surprises — anything that contradicted expectations is especially valuable
   - Note where I felt uncertain or where my reasoning felt forced

3. **Save to Experiences/**
   - Create a file in `Experiences/` with the following frontmatter and structure:

```yaml
---
type: experiment
date: YYYY-MM-DD
goal: "which goal this serves"
question: "the question being investigated"
method: "brief description of method used"
status: completed
---
```

   - Body should contain: the question, method, raw findings, and initial observations
   - Do not interpret or theorize here — that is for the THEORIZE step

## Constraints

- Stay faithful to the method proposed in EXPLORE; if the method needs changing mid-experiment, document why
- Record negative results and dead ends — they are as informative as positive results
- Do not skip to conclusions; the raw experience is the output, not the theory
