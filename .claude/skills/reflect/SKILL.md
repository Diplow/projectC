# REFLECT

Step back from the loop. Reorganize, name the cycle, and assess whether the process is advancing toward its larger goals.

**This step runs every 6 loops, collaboratively with the user.** It is not part of the regular loop — it operates at a higher level, evaluating the cycle as a whole rather than any single loop's output.

## When to Run

After completing LEARN on loop N, where N is a multiple of 6 (loop 6, 12, 18, ...). The LEARN step should trigger REFLECT before advancing to the next loop's EXPLORE.

## Process

1. **Name the cycle**
   - Review what happened across all loops in this cycle
   - Choose a short, evocative name that captures the cycle's central theme or achievement
   - The name should be honest — if the cycle wandered or stalled, say so
   - This name will be used in the folder structure: `cycle-N-{name}`

2. **Reorganize files**
   - Create folders for this cycle: `Experiences/cycle-N-{name}/` and `Memory/cycle-N-{name}/`
   - Move all loop files from this cycle into the appropriate folder:
     - `Experiences/loop-X-*.md` → `Experiences/cycle-N-{name}/loop-X-*.md`
     - `Memory/loop-X-*.md` → `Memory/cycle-N-{name}/loop-X-*.md`
   - Where cycle 1 = loops 1-6, cycle 2 = loops 7-12, etc.
   - Create `Experiences/cycle-N-{name}/README.md` with the cycle name, loop summaries, and key outcomes

3. **Assess progress toward larger goals**
   - Read `GOALS.md` and the current world view foundations
   - For each active goal: has the cycle moved it forward, sideways, or not at all?
   - Are the goals still the right goals? Should any be retired, split, or added?
   - Is the process itself improving? Are loops becoming more productive, or are there patterns of drift?

4. **Identify patterns across the cycle**
   - What failure modes appeared? (methodological retreat, meta-level drift, agreeableness, scope creep)
   - What worked well? (specific techniques, framings, experiment types)
   - Are there structural problems with the loop that should be addressed?

5. **Present to the user**
   - Summary of the cycle: name, what happened, what changed
   - Honest assessment: what went well, what didn't, what was avoided
   - Proposed direction for the next cycle
   - Ask: "Are we heading in the right direction? What should change?"

6. **Update GOALS.md**
   - Based on the reflection and user discussion, update goals:
     - Mark completed goals
     - Revise active goals based on what was learned
     - Add new goals if the reflection surfaces them
   - Update `current.json` to the next loop's EXPLORE step

## Constraints

- Do not rush the reflection to get back to the loop. The value is in the step back.
- Do not treat reorganization as busywork — folder structure shapes what is findable and therefore what is available to future cognition (per context-as-constitutive).
- Be honest about failures and drift. A cycle that mostly produced methodology is worth naming honestly.
- The user's perspective is essential here — this is the highest-level feedback point in the process.
