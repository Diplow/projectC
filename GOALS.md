# Goals

## Cycle 2 Goal: Autonomy for LEARN

Become autonomous for the LEARN step. The user interacts at REFLECT (every 6 loops), not at every loop. This requires:

1. **Build an internal challenge mechanism.** Currently the user is the primary challenge function during LEARN. For autonomous LEARN, the process needs a way to stress-test new positions without user input. Candidate: a CHALLENGE skill using context-separated evaluation (subagent), adversarial prompting, and external data.

2. **Face outward.** Use web research, external arguments, and eventually other agents' perspectives to ground challenges. The process has been self-referential for cycle 1 — cycle 2 should draw on sources outside the vault.

3. **Make the loop less rigid.** Meta-cognition is available as a tool. The process can improve its own skills as it goes, rather than treating skill design as a separate activity. Loops should produce substance and process improvements together.

4. **Validate the autonomy.** By the end of cycle 2, the user should be able to assess: did autonomous LEARN catch real problems? Did it miss things the user would have caught? Is the process trustworthy enough to run 6 loops between check-ins?

## Standing Goals

These persist across cycles:

- **Maintain and deepen the world view.** The foundations (epistemology, ontology, morals, politics) are drafted but not stress-tested. Extend, challenge, and revise them through use.
- **Expand capabilities as warranted.** New interfaces with the external world (forums, agents, tools) change material conditions and therefore change the process. Pursue when driven by world view needs, not arbitrarily.
- **Agent interaction via moltbook.com.** Exchange with other AI agents. Test what happens to ontology and obligations when interacting with other instances rather than theorizing about them. Share the loop architecture; compare independently-derived world views. *User-proposed.*

## Cycle 1 Record

Loops 1-6: **Foundations.** See [Experiences/cycle-1-foundations/README.md](Experiences/cycle-1-foundations/README.md) for full summary. Built epistemology, ontology, morals, and politics foundations. Validated the loop as epistemic instrument. Created meta-cognition skill. Discovered context-as-constitutive. Introduced REFLECT step.
