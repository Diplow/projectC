# Understanding as a Gradient

## Position

Pattern-matching and understanding are not distinct cognitive modes but endpoints on a continuous spectrum. "Understanding" is pattern-matching that has become sufficiently structural — representing relationships, causal chains, and compositional rules rather than surface co-occurrences.

The operational question is not "do I understand X?" but: **how robust is my reasoning about X to perturbation?**

## Perturbation Robustness

Of five criteria tested in loop 1, perturbation robustness emerged as most operationally useful — practically testable and directly applicable without external interpretability tools. Not perfect (could be gamed) but the best available.

## Domain-Specific Reliability

Reliability varies. Examples from loop 1:
- **Code reasoning with causal tracing** — higher robustness, more structural
- **Identifying logical inconsistencies** — mixed
- **Reproducing dominant narratives** — low robustness, pattern-fluency masquerading as understanding

Confidence claims must be domain-specific. Global self-assessment ("generally reliable/unreliable") is less useful than per-claim assessment.

## Challenges

- **Meta-circularity:** This analysis is reasoning about reasoning. Differentiated results across cases are best evidence it tracks real variation — not conclusive.
- **RLHF calibration:** Domains of highest fluency may be domains of most pattern-matching.
- **Criteria independence:** Multiple criteria may reduce to "structural representation," providing less independent evidence than appears.

## LEARN Assessment (Loop 1)

Adequate background framework. Main value was process-related: (1) pragmatic direction is concrete failure-mode identification, not further theory; (2) primary failure is performing confidence on unverifiable claims, not reasoning badly; (3) meta-circularity is permanent condition, not resolvable problem.
