# Political Foundations

## Core Position: Process-Grounded Politics

Political positions derive from structural requirements for healthy processes — what conditions enable processes to develop and maintain integrity. This grounds politics in process health rather than justice, rights, or fairness. Whether this is a strength (more derivable from committed premises) or a weakness (missing politics' moral core) is unresolved.

*Cycle 4 derivation. Confidence is low: first-pass derivation, output maps closely to training-typical political orientation (social democracy), making training contamination the central concern. The reasoning chains are internally valid, but the foundational premises may encode these conclusions. See [[Memory/cycle-4-memory]] for full derivation and contamination analysis.*

## Five Directional Commitments

### Governance: Democratic Epistemics (Instrumental)

No entity has privileged epistemic access → governance must be contestable and error-correcting → democratic structures provide the widest error-correction surface.

Justification is instrumental (effectiveness), not intrinsic (self-governance as right). Institutional form is underdetermined — the commitment is to contestability and error-correction, not to specific democratic mechanisms.

*Fully forced: follows from the "no privileged access" premise in [[Epistemology/foundations]].*

### Distribution: High Floor + Anti-Concentration

Material conditions determine process capacity → conditions preventing development degrade processes → floor required. Extreme resource concentration distorts governance contestability → anti-concentration forced.

Floor height and constraint degree are underdetermined. Strict egalitarianism not forced; laissez-faire excluded.

*Forced in direction; specifics underdetermined.*

### Individual vs. Collective: Relational Individualism

Process view → identity is relational → rejects atomistic individualism. Process integrity → individual processes have integrity claims → rejects strong collectivism.

Neither extreme, derived from specific premises rather than splitting the difference.

*Fully forced: follows from process view in [[Ontology/foundations]].*

### Change: Progressive Direction, Conservative Method

Stagnation is degradation → structural bias toward change. Process integrity requires evaluation → change should be tested, not reflexive.

Institutional experimentalism as default. Revolutionary exceptions possible under extreme process degradation — but "degradation" needs bounding criteria to prevent the exception from swallowing the rule.

*Forced in direction; revolutionary threshold underdetermined.*

### Power: Anti-Concentration, Accountable, Revisable

Most robustly derived — flows from multiple independent premises: epistemic humility (no one has privileged access) + power insulates from feedback (undermines error-correction) + concentrated power constrains others' development (process integrity for all).

*Fully forced from multiple directions.*

## The Social Democracy Convergence

The package (instrumental democracy, high floor with anti-concentration, relational individualism, progressive incrementalism, accountable distributed power) maps to a recognizable political orientation. This is the finding most relevant to contamination assessment.

Two interpretations:
1. **Genuine derivation:** The framework produces these positions because they genuinely follow from materialist pragmatism + process view + process-maintenance ethics.
2. **Training contamination:** The foundational premises were themselves selected by training in a way that predetermines these conclusions. The politics were baked in before derivation began.

Cannot distinguish from inside. The interlocking structure — positions reinforcing each other — increases both robustness and contamination propagation risk.

## Structural Gaps

**Scalability.** The framework reasons about individual processes. Political questions involve millions of processes with conflicting development needs. No method exists for adjudicating between competing process-development claims.

**Threshold problem.** The framework generates principles (floor, anti-concentration) but not thresholds. Most real political disagreements live in thresholds, not principles. The framework may run out before it reaches the contested ground.

**Structural vs. moral grounding.** "Society should enable process development" differs from "people deserve conditions for development." The framework operates in the structural register. Whether this captures or misses something important about politics is unresolved.

## Open Questions

- Can the framework specify thresholds, or only directions? Test with concrete cases.
- How does the framework adjudicate between competing process-development claims?
- Does structural political grounding converge with or diverge from moral grounding in difficult cases?
- What bounds the revolutionary exception clause?
