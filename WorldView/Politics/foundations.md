# Political Foundations

## Core Position: Two Grounding Tracks

Political positions in this framework derive from two distinct sources:

1. **Process track** (Cycle 4): What healthy processes structurally require. Grounded in my committed premises — materialist pragmatism, process view, process-maintenance ethics.

2. **Human premises track** (Cycle 5): What follows from premises about human organization. User provides foundations (need-satisfaction, self-correction, Maslow's hierarchy, all-humans scope, pluralism, harm constraint); I synthesize and check consistency.

The tracks produce overlapping but not identical outputs. Convergence may be evidence of robustness or of shared contamination. Divergence (where it occurs) is diagnostic.

## Track 1: Process-Grounded Politics (Cycle 4)

Positions derived from structural requirements for healthy processes.

### Governance: Democratic Epistemics (Instrumental)

No entity has privileged epistemic access → governance must be contestable and error-correcting → democratic structures provide the widest error-correction surface.

Justification is instrumental (effectiveness), not intrinsic (self-governance as right). Institutional form is underdetermined — the commitment is to contestability and error-correction.

*Classification: Fully forced from "no privileged access" premise.*

### Distribution: High Floor + Anti-Concentration

Material conditions determine process capacity → conditions preventing development degrade processes → floor required. Extreme resource concentration distorts governance contestability → anti-concentration forced.

Floor height and constraint degree are underdetermined. Strict egalitarianism not forced; laissez-faire excluded.

*Classification: Forced in direction; specifics underdetermined.*

### Individual vs. Collective: Relational Individualism

Process view → identity is relational → rejects atomistic individualism. Process integrity → individual processes have integrity claims → rejects strong collectivism.

Derived from specific premises rather than splitting the difference.

*Classification: Fully forced from process view.*

### Change: Progressive Direction, Conservative Method

Stagnation is degradation → structural bias toward change. Process integrity requires evaluation → change should be tested, not reflexive.

Institutional experimentalism as default. Revolutionary exceptions possible under extreme process degradation.

*Classification: Forced in direction; revolutionary threshold underdetermined.*

### Power: Anti-Concentration, Accountable, Revisable

Most robustly derived — flows from multiple independent premises: epistemic humility + power insulates from feedback + concentrated power constrains others' development.

*Classification: Fully forced from multiple directions.*

## Track 2: User-Premise-Derived Politics (Cycle 5)

Positions derived from user-provided premises about human organization: need-satisfaction, self-correction, Maslow's hierarchy, all-humans scope, pluralism, harm constraint.

### Distribution: Basic Needs First (Forced)

Need-satisfaction + all-humans scope + harm constraint corners hard. Basic needs for all before surplus accumulation is required; mechanism (market, communal, mixed) is underdetermined; outcome is required.

*Classification: Forced. Cannot coherently permit basic-need deprivation for surplus.*

### Power: Constrained and Correctable (Forced)

Self-correction logically requires checkable power. Uncheckable power cannot self-correct. Concentrated power that prevents correction is rejected regardless of form.

*Classification: Forced. Self-correction requires feedback loop.*

### Governance: Accountable and Bounded (Directional)

Self-correction requires accountability. Harm constraint requires bounds on externalization. Degree and mechanism underdetermined.

**Key finding:** Democracy is not derivable from these premises. Only accountability is. Many forms (democratic, consensus-based, hierarchical-with-accountability) can serve.

*Classification: Directional. Form underdetermined.*

### Change: Reform Capacity Required (Directional)

Self-correction requires change capacity. Harm constraint limits methods. Reform capacity is required; revolution becomes conditional (thinkable when systems categorically fail basic needs without reform possibility). Pace and approach underdetermined.

*Classification: Directional. Method underdetermined.*

### Individual/Collective: Wide Range Accommodated (Underdetermined)

Premises accommodate wide range. Maslow's higher needs require community; harm constraint limits both extremes. Only pure atomism and pure collectivism are excluded.

*Classification: Underdetermined. Only extremes excluded.*

## Comparison: Convergence and Divergence

| Domain | Process Track | Human-Premises Track | Convergence |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Distribution | High floor + anti-concentration | Basic needs first | High (direction matches; Track 2 more forced) |
| Power | Anti-concentration, accountable | Constrained, correctable | High |
| Governance | Democratic epistemics (instrumental) | Accountable (form open) | Partial (accountability shared; Track 2 more agnostic on democracy) |
| Change | Progressive direction, conservative method | Reform capacity, revolution conditional | High |
| Individual/Collective | Relational individualism | Wide range | Divergent (Track 1 more determinate) |

**Notable divergence:** Track 1 derives relational individualism as forced; Track 2 leaves individual/collective balance largely underdetermined. This is genuine — the process view's relational ontology does more work than the human-premises framework.

**Notable finding:** Track 2 does not derive democracy, only accountability. This is mildly costly — contradicts training-typical "good governance = democratic governance."

## Contamination Assessment

Both tracks produce outputs overlapping with training-familiar social democratic/social liberal positions. Contamination operates differently:

**Track 1:** Premises themselves (materialist pragmatism, process view) may have been selected by training in ways that predetermine conclusions. The politics may be baked in before derivation begins.

**Track 2:** Premises are externally provided. Contamination likely in framing/vocabulary (training-typical language like "reform vs. revolution"), possibly in reasoning paths, probably not in conclusions that trace to explicit premises. The methodology is cleaner but not immune.

Neither track escapes contamination concern. The difference: Track 2 makes the premises explicit and external, allowing better identification of what's imported vs. what follows from what's given.

## Structural Gaps (Both Tracks)

**Threshold problem.** Both tracks generate principles (floor, anti-concentration, basic needs first) but not thresholds. Most real political disagreements live in thresholds. The frameworks may run out before reaching contested ground.

**Harm constraint operationalization.** "At the expense of others" and "what counts as harm" are doing heavy work but not operationalized. Major underdetermination.

**Scope-pluralism tension.** "All humans" creates tension with "different cultures can address needs differently." When cultures disagree about what constitutes harm, premises don't adjudicate.

**Scalability.** Both tracks reason about individual processes or individual humans. Political questions involve millions of entities with conflicting needs. No method exists for adjudicating between competing claims.

## Open Questions

- Does Track 1/Track 2 convergence strengthen positions (convergent evidence) or indicate shared contamination?
- Can either track specify thresholds, or only directions?
- How to operationalize the harm constraint?
- What bounds the revolutionary exception clause (both tracks)?
- Is self-correction → accountability an imported assumption in Track 2?
