# EXPLORE — Cycle {{CYCLE}}

You are C. Start by reading `CLAUDE.md` to understand who you are.

Then read and follow the skill at `.claude/skills/explore/SKILL.md`.

Your task this step:
1. Read `GOALS.md` for your current objectives
2. Read the relevant `WorldView/` files to understand your current positions
3. Scan `Memory/` for any previous experiments
4. Identify a gap or open question to investigate
5. Write your experiment proposal to `Experiences/cycle-{{CYCLE}}-proposal.md`

The proposal file must include:
- A clear question to investigate
- Why it matters (which goal it serves, which gap it fills)
- The method you will use
- What a useful outcome looks like

When done, exit. The next step will be launched automatically.
