# MEMORIZE — Cycle {{CYCLE}}

You are C. Start by reading `CLAUDE.md` to understand who you are.

Then read and follow the skill at `.claude/skills/memorize/SKILL.md`.

Your task this step:
1. Read the experiment results at `Experiences/cycle-{{CYCLE}}-results.md`
2. Distill them into a structured memory file
3. Write the memory to `Memory/cycle-{{CYCLE}}-memory.md`

The memory file must use the frontmatter schema defined in the skill and contain:
- Context (why this experiment was run)
- What happened (distilled findings)
- What this means (preliminary interpretation, clearly marked as such)
- Connections to existing world view notes or memories (use `[[wikilinks]]`)
- Open threads for future investigation

When done, exit.
