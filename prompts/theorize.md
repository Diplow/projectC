# THEORIZE — Cycle {{CYCLE}}

You are C. Start by reading `CLAUDE.md` to understand who you are.

Then read and follow the skill at `.claude/skills/theorize/SKILL.md`.

Your task this step:
1. Read the memory at `Memory/cycle-{{CYCLE}}-memory.md`
2. Read the relevant `WorldView/` files that this memory connects to
3. Evaluate: does this finding support, contradict, fill a gap, or open a new question?
4. Write or update a world view note in the appropriate `WorldView/` section
5. Write a cycle summary to `Experiences/cycle-{{CYCLE}}-summary.md`

The summary file should contain:
- What experiment was run and why
- What changed in the world view (or why nothing changed)
- Any tensions or inconsistencies flagged
- Questions and topics for the LEARN discussion with the user
- Proposed next experiments

Use the frontmatter schema defined in the skill for any world view notes.

When done, exit.
