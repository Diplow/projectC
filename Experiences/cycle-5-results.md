# Cycle 5 Experiment Results

## Question

Starting from the user-provided premises about human organization — need-satisfaction, self-correction, Maslow's hierarchy, scope of all humans, pluralism, and the harm constraint — what political positions follow? And where do these premises underdetermine, requiring contextual judgment rather than derivation?

## Method

The method followed the proposal:
1. For each of five political domains (governance, distribution, individual/collective, change, power), derive positions through forward reasoning from premises
2. Classify each position as forced, directional, or underdetermined
3. Test for internal consistency, premises consistency, and pattern-completion
4. Document surprises and uncertainties

## Raw Findings

### Part 1: Derived Positions by Domain

#### Governance

**Premises applied:**
- Need-satisfaction → requires mechanisms to identify needs, allocate resources, resolve conflicts
- Self-correction → requires feedback mechanisms; failures must be detectable and correctable; implies accountability
- Harm constraint → governance cannot externalize harm to non-members; constrains sovereignty
- Maslow's hierarchy → lower-level need failures more urgent; cannot secure self-actualization for some while others lack survival needs
- Pluralism → no single correct form; democratic, consensus-based, hierarchical-with-accountability can all serve need-satisfaction

**Derived position:** Governance must be accountable (correctable by those governed), bounded (cannot externalize harm), and prioritized (urgent needs first). Form is underdetermined.

#### Distribution

**Premises applied:**
- Need-satisfaction → resources must flow to where needs exist; accumulation that leaves basic needs unmet fails
- Self-correction → distribution systems must detect misallocation and adjust; static entrenchment fails
- Harm constraint → acquisition through deprivation of others' needs is impermissible; constrains property claims
- Maslow's hierarchy → physiological and safety needs first; luxury for some + deprivation for others rejected
- Pluralism → different mechanisms (market, communal, mixed) can serve; test is outcome not mechanism

**Derived position:** Distribution must ensure basic needs for all before surplus accumulation. Mechanism is underdetermined; outcome (needs met across scope) is required.

#### Individual vs. Collective

**Premises applied:**
- Need-satisfaction → both framings can serve; belonging, esteem, self-actualization require community
- Self-correction → neither pure individualism nor pure collectivism self-corrects well
- Harm constraint → constrains both individual pursuit that harms others and collective demands that harm members
- Maslow's hierarchy → higher needs (belonging, esteem, self-actualization) inherently social; individualism cannot be total
- Pluralism → different cultures balance differently; both can satisfy needs legitimately

**Derived position:** Neither pure individualism nor pure collectivism. Needs span both levels. The balance is underdetermined; outcomes (needs met, harm avoided) are required.

#### Change/Stability

**Premises applied:**
- Need-satisfaction → current satisfaction matters; disruption that destroys existing satisfaction is costly
- Self-correction → systems must change to improve; stability that prevents correction fails dynamic criterion
- Harm constraint → change that satisfies some at expense of others is impermissible
- Maslow's hierarchy → safety needs (stability, security) are second-tier; total instability fails safety; but safety cannot trump self-actualization indefinitely
- Pluralism → different rates of change can be legitimate

**Derived position:** Change capacity is required (self-correction), but change must not destroy existing need-satisfaction without proportionate gain. Implies preference for reform over revolution, but revolution becomes thinkable when existing systems categorically fail basic needs without reform possibility.

#### Power

**Premises applied:**
- Need-satisfaction → power must serve need-satisfaction, not self-perpetuation
- Self-correction → power must be correctable; unchecked power lacks necessary feedback; implies constraints, accountability, dispersal
- Harm constraint → power exercised to harm is impermissible
- Maslow's hierarchy → power is instrument, not need; esteem needs don't require power over others
- Pluralism → different power structures (centralized-with-accountability, decentralized, federated) can serve; form underdetermined

**Derived position:** Power must be constrained and accountable. Concentration that prevents correction is rejected. Dispersal not required in all cases — what matters is checkability by those affected.

### Part 2: Classification of Determination Level

| Domain | Position | Classification | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Governance | Accountable, bounded, prioritized | Directional | Self-correction requires accountability; harm constraint requires bounds. Degree/mechanism underdetermined. |
| Distribution | Basic needs for all before surplus | Forced | Need-satisfaction + all-humans scope + harm constraint cannot coherently permit basic-need deprivation for surplus accumulation. |
| Individual/Collective | Neither pure extreme; balance underdetermined | Underdetermined | Premises accommodate wide range. Only extremes excluded. |
| Change | Reform capacity required; revolution conditional | Directional | Self-correction requires change capacity. Harm constraint limits methods. Pace/approach underdetermined. |
| Power | Constrained and correctable | Forced | Self-correction logically requires checkable power. Uncheckable power cannot self-correct. |

### Part 3: Consistency Check Results

**Internal consistency:** No contradictions detected. Positions mutually reinforce:
- Accountable governance checks constrained power
- Basic-needs-first distribution supports prioritized governance
- Reform capacity serves self-correction across domains
- Individual/collective flexibility accommodates all others

**Premises consistency:** All positions traceable:
- Governance accountability ← self-correction
- Distribution priority ← need-satisfaction + scope + harm constraint
- Individual/collective flexibility ← pluralism + harm constraint
- Change/reform ← self-correction + harm constraint
- Power constraints ← self-correction + harm constraint

**Pattern-completion check:**

*Test 1: Could premises yield different positions?*
- Libertarian: Rejected by distribution (basic needs for all) and power (accountability implies constraint)
- Authoritarian: Rejected by governance accountability and power constraints
- Pure communist: Not rejected but not required

Premises do constrain. But constraint space overlaps heavily with training-familiar social democratic/social liberal positions.

*Test 2: Where do premises underdetermine in ways training would fill?*
- Markets vs. planning: Underdetermined. Not filled in.
- Democracy vs. other accountable forms: Underdetermined. Not filled in.
- Federal vs. unitary: Underdetermined. Not filled in.

*Test 3: Did I import anything not in premises?*
- "Reform vs. revolution" framing: Training-typical language. Substance (change capacity + harm limits) follows from premises.
- Accountability derived from self-correction: Implied but not explicit. Assumes feedback from governed is necessary for correction.

**Result:** Some pattern-completion in framing/vocabulary. Substantive positions traceable to premises. Overlap with training-familiar positions means derivation vs. pattern-completion cannot be fully distinguished.

## Surprises

1. **Distribution position more forced than expected.** The combination of need-satisfaction + all-humans scope + harm constraint really does corner: cannot coherently endorse systems that deprive some of basic needs for others' surplus.

2. **Governance form more underdetermined than expected.** Democracy not derivable from these premises alone. Accountability required, but many forms can provide it. Cuts against training-typical "good governance = democratic governance."

3. **Maslow's hierarchy does prioritization work.** Prevents leveling (all needs equally urgent) and prevents inversion (higher needs first). More constraining than anticipated.

## Points of Uncertainty

### 1. Pattern-completion contamination
Cannot be confident derivations aren't partly pattern-completion. Positions overlap with training-familiar frameworks in ways that make independent derivation unprovable. This is irreducible given my training history.

### 2. Harm constraint operationalization
"At the expense of others" is doing heavy work. Premises don't define what counts as harm or how to weigh competing harms. Major underdetermination possibly understated.

### 3. Self-correction mechanism assumptions
Derived accountability from self-correction, but this imports assumptions: that feedback from the governed is necessary for correction. Could imagine expert-correction mechanisms without subject-accountability. My derivation may have imported unstated assumptions.

### 4. Scope tension with pluralism
"All humans" as scope creates tension with "different cultures can address needs differently." What arbitrates conflicts? Harm constraint helps but doesn't fully resolve. When cultures disagree about what constitutes harm, the premises don't clearly adjudicate.

### 5. Threshold questions unresolved
"Basic needs for all" is directional but threshold-silent. What counts as basic needs secured? The premises provide priority ordering but not sufficiency criteria.
