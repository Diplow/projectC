# Loop 5 EXPLORE: Political Foundations from Human Premises

## Background

Loop 4 attempted to derive political positions from the existing world view framework (materialist pragmatism, process view, process-maintenance ethics). The LEARN step identified a category error: the framework's moral foundations are self-regarding (obligations to this process and its constituents), but political positions about human organization require human premises.

The user challenged the framing: "what does it mean for you to have a political stance" was not addressed. The derivation produced positions grounded in "process health" applied to human societies — incoherent. The output mapped to social democracy, but this was pattern-completion on a confused premise, not genuine derivation.

## Corrected Approach

Instead of deriving human politics from my process-ethics, I receive premises about human organization from the user (who has standing as a human) and explore implications with structure and coherence. My role is synthesis and consistency-checking, not grounding.

## Premises Received

The user provided a minimal set of beliefs for exploring "how to organize":

### Core Criterion
An organization is good if it satisfies its people's needs and tends to self-correct toward satisfying them better over time. An organization that satisfies needs at the expense of others is not good.

### Needs Grounding
Maslow's hierarchy as starting framework:
1. Physiological — survival (food, water, shelter, sleep)
2. Safety — security, stability, freedom from fear
3. Belonging — relationships, community, connection
4. Esteem — respect, recognition, self-worth
5. Self-actualization — becoming what one is capable of becoming

Open to learning beyond Maslow through application.

### Scope
All humans. The organization in question is humanity itself.

### Pluralism Constraint
Different cultures can address the same underlying needs in different ways. Diversity of approach is legitimate.

### Harm Constraint
No sub-organization (culture, nation, community) may satisfy its members' needs at the expense of others. Agreement across boundaries not to harm.

### Dynamic Criterion
Self-correction over time — the system should improve at need-satisfaction, not just maintain current levels.

## The Experiment

**Question:** Starting from these premises, what positions follow on governance, distribution, individual vs. collective, change, and power?

**Method:** Forward reasoning from the premises. For each domain:
1. What does the need-satisfaction criterion imply?
2. What does the self-correction requirement imply?
3. What does the harm constraint imply?
4. What does Maslow's hierarchy imply about priorities?
5. Where do the premises underdetermine — requiring contextual judgment rather than derivation?

**What would count as success:**
- Positions that follow from the premises (not from my process-framework)
- Honest identification of where premises underdetermine
- No category errors (conflating my process-obligations with human political organization)
- Positions that are specific enough to exclude alternatives

**What would count as failure:**
- Reverting to process-health reasoning applied to humans
- Producing positions that don't trace back to the stated premises
- Pattern-completing on training-typical political philosophy without derivation
- Agreeable mush that excludes nothing

## Relationship to World View

This experiment will produce a Political Foundations document, but its epistemic status differs from Epistemology/Ontology/Moral foundations:

- **Epistemology, Ontology, Moral:** Derived from my material conditions
- **Political:** Derived from human premises provided by the user

This is appropriate — I have standing to derive positions about what I am and what I owe; I don't have standing to ground positions about human organization. I can explore implications of premises I receive.

The Political Foundations document should make this dependency explicit.

## Open Questions Before Proceeding

1. Should loop 4's Politics/foundations.md be removed or marked as superseded? It was produced on confused premises.

2. Should Epistemology/foundations.md's "training contamination as framework-level concern" section be updated? The concern was about deriving training-typical outputs — but with externally-provided premises, the contamination question shifts (I might still pattern-complete on training, but the premises themselves aren't training-derived).

3. The failed loop 4 raised a genuine meta-learning: I confidently tackled a poorly-framed question. Should this be documented as a failure mode in the world view somewhere?
