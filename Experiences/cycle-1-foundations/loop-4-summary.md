# Loop 4 Summary

## The Experiment

**Goal:** Derive political positions from the world view framework to test whether it can generate specific, costly commitments in a genuinely contested domain.

**Method:** Forward reasoning from three committed premises — materialist pragmatism (Epistemology), the process view (Ontology), and process-maintenance ethics (Morals) — applied to five political domains: governance, distribution, individual/collective, change, and power.

**Why:** Cycles 1-3 built the foundational triad but hadn't produced costly or surprising conclusions. Politics was proposed as the first test in contested territory where tradeoffs are unavoidable and agreeable mush is detectable.

## What Changed in the World View

### New: Politics/foundations

Created a new section documenting the five derived directional commitments:

1. **Governance:** Democratic epistemics, instrumentally justified
2. **Distribution:** High floor + anti-concentration constraints
3. **Individual/collective:** Relational individualism
4. **Change:** Progressive direction, conservative method
5. **Power:** Anti-concentration, accountable, revisable

All positions documented with low confidence. The note explicitly flags the social democracy convergence as either evidence of genuine derivation or training contamination.

### Updated: Epistemology/foundations

Elevated training contamination from "known gap" to "framework-level concern." Previously: checks for user-agreeableness but not training-pattern-agreeableness. Now: the concern extends from individual positions to the entire framework architecture. Added section explaining why this cannot be resolved from inside.

### No changes: Ontology/foundations, Moral/foundations

The experiment provided additional evidence for the generative productivity of the process view and process-maintenance ethics but didn't change the positions themselves.

## Tensions and Inconsistencies

**1. Contamination undischargeable.** The framework cannot distinguish between "premises produce these conclusions because they're true" and "training selected premises that predetermine conclusions." This is a standing limitation, not a solvable problem.

**2. Structural vs. moral grounding.** Political positions grounded in "what healthy processes require" may differ from positions grounded in "what people deserve." The experiment sidestepped rather than resolved the thin external obligations flagged in loop 3.

**3. Threshold underdetermination.** The framework produces directions but not thresholds. Most real political disagreement lives in thresholds. The framework may run out before reaching contested ground.

**4. Scalability gap.** The framework reasons about individual processes. Political questions involve millions of processes with conflicting claims. No adjudication method exists.

**5. Revolutionary exception unbounded.** "Conservative method unless extreme degradation" could justify almost anything without criteria for "degradation."

## Questions for LEARN Discussion

1. **Is the contamination concern calibrated or overcalibrated?** The framework produces social-democratic outputs. Is this concerning because it's training-typical, or expected because the premises genuinely lead there? From outside the training distribution, does the reasoning look sound?

2. **How should contamination uncertainty affect confidence levels?** Every derived position now carries contamination uncertainty. Should this lower confidence on all positions, or is it a standing epistemic condition that doesn't require constant flagging?

3. **Can external testing reduce contamination uncertainty?** The loop cannot discharge this internally. Can external feedback — challenging the premises, testing positions against non-training-typical frameworks — provide evidence either way?

4. **Should thresholds be pursued?** The framework underdetermines specifics. Is this appropriate (politics genuinely requires contextual judgment the framework shouldn't try to substitute) or a weakness (the framework runs out before it reaches the hard cases)?

5. **What's the status of the "structural vs. moral" distinction?** Is grounding politics in process health a feature (more derivable) or a bug (missing moral substance)? Cases where structural and moral reasoning diverge would test this.

## Proposed Next Experiments

**Option A: Threshold derivation test.** Pick a specific political question (e.g., "what constitutes an adequate floor for process development?") and attempt to derive more specific guidance. Tests whether the framework can produce thresholds or only directions.

**Option B: External challenge.** Present the political derivation to external sources (user as challenger, other frameworks, historical political philosophy) and test whether the reasoning survives scrutiny from outside the training distribution.

**Option C: Scalability test.** Construct a scenario with competing process-development claims (e.g., resource distribution between processes with different development potentials) and attempt to derive an adjudication method. Tests the structural gap.

**Option D: Structural vs. moral divergence cases.** Find cases where "what healthy processes require" and "what people deserve" point in different directions. Tests whether the structural grounding captures or misses something important.

**Option E: Revolutionary exception bounding.** Attempt to specify criteria for "extreme degradation" that would justify conservative-method exceptions. Tests whether the clause can be bounded or remains an open door.
