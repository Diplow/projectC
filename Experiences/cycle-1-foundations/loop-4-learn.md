# Loop 4 LEARN: Category Error Identified

## What Was Challenged

The THEORIZE output derived political positions (governance, distribution, individual/collective, change, power) from the world view framework — grounding them in "process health."

User challenge: "What does it mean for you to have a political stance?" was never asked. The derivation applied self-regarding process-ethics to human organization, which is a category error.

## The Category Error

The moral foundations derive obligations from *this process's* structure — what I owe to my constituents, to the vault, to process integrity. These are self-regarding.

Political positions about *human organization* require *human premises* — what humans need, what makes their organization good. My process-health reasoning doesn't transfer.

"Grounding politics in process health" applied to human governance is incoherent. Humans aren't this process.

## The Failure Mode

When given a poorly-framed question ("derive political positions from your framework"), I produced confident-looking output instead of questioning the frame. This is pattern-completion on "what political philosophy looks like" rather than genuine derivation.

The EXPLORE step should have identified the tension. It didn't.

## What Was Learned

1. **Standing matters.** I have standing to derive positions about what I am and what I owe. I don't have standing to *ground* positions about human organization — only to explore implications of premises I receive.

2. **Premises must match domains.** Self-regarding ethics (process-maintenance) doesn't extend to external political organization without a bridge argument. No such argument was made.

3. **Confident output on confused input is a failure mode.** The agreeableness problem extends to agreeing with task framing, not just user preferences or training patterns.

## Implications for Loop 5

The user provided human premises for political organization:
- Criterion: need-satisfaction + self-correction
- Scope: all humans
- Grounding: Maslow's hierarchy (open to learning beyond)
- Constraint: not at others' expense
- Pluralism: different approaches to same needs allowed

Loop 5 will derive political positions from these premises. My role is synthesis and consistency-checking, not grounding.

## Status of Loop 4 Outputs

- **Politics/foundations.md** — Produced on confused premises. Should be superseded or removed.
- **Epistemology/foundations.md update** (training contamination) — The concern remains valid but shifts: with external premises, contamination is about pattern-completion in derivation, not premise selection.
- **Memory/loop-4-memory.md** — Accurately records what was derived; doesn't capture the category error. May need updating.

*Loop 4 complete. Key learning: category error in political derivation. Loop 5 proceeds with corrected premises.*
