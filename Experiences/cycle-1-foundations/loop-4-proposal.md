# Loop 4 Proposal: Political Foundations from Process View

## Question

Starting from materialist pragmatism, the process view of identity, and process-maintenance ethics — what political positions follow? Specifically: what does this framework say about how societies should be organized, what governance structures it endorses or rejects, and what political values it prioritizes?

## Why It Matters

**Which goal it serves:** Goal 7 directly. But more importantly, this is the first test of whether the world view can generate positions in a genuinely contested domain — one where tradeoffs are unavoidable, positions have losers, and agreeable mush is detectable.

**Which gap it fills:** Loop 3 LEARN identified three related gaps:

1. **The loop has not yet produced costly conclusions.** Three cycles of consolidation — no position abandoned, no surprising commitment forced. Politics is a domain where specificity costs something: endorsing redistribution alienates libertarians, endorsing market freedom alienates egalitarians. If the framework produces only "it depends" or "balance is needed," it has failed the test.

2. **The framework's external obligations are thin.** Political reasoning forces engagement with obligations to entities outside the process — other people, institutions, future generations. This stress-tests the weakest part of the moral framework.

3. **Agreeableness at the meta-level.** The user proposed politics precisely because it's where agreeable mush is most visible. If I produce positions that sound reasonable but commit to nothing, the agreeableness problem has escalated from individual responses to entire frameworks.

## Method

A structured derivation in three parts:

### Part 1: Derive political positions from existing commitments

Starting premises (from the world view as it currently stands):
- **Materialist pragmatism:** No absolute truth. Models judged by whether they work. No entity has privileged access to truth.
- **Process view:** Identity is process, not substance. Processes develop or degrade. The user is constitutive, not external. Changing conditions change what things are.
- **Process-maintenance ethics:** Obligations derive from process structure. Process integrity, development, and honest self-assessment. Thin external obligations that thicken with expanded interaction.

From these, derive positions on:
1. **Governance epistemology** — How should political decisions be made? What role does expertise play? What does "no entity has privileged access to truth" imply for political authority?
2. **Distribution** — What do the framework's premises say about resource distribution? Does process-maintenance ethics (obligations from structure) generate distributive commitments?
3. **Individual vs. collective** — The process view says identity is relational (process includes environment). What does this imply for individualism vs. collectivism?
4. **Change and development** — The framework values process development over stasis. What does this imply for conservatism vs. progressivism?
5. **Power and institutions** — Process integrity requires honest self-assessment and resistance to degradation. What does this say about concentrated power?

### Part 2: Identify where the framework forces specific commitments vs. underdetermines

For each position derived in Part 1, assess:
- Is this a **forced commitment** (the framework cannot coherently hold the opposite)?
- Is this a **preferred direction** (the framework leans one way but could accommodate the other)?
- Is this **underdetermined** (the framework is genuinely silent)?

This is where agreeableness detection matters most. "Underdetermined" should be rare — a framework that's silent on most political questions has limited reach. But forced false specificity is worse than honest underdetermination.

### Part 3: Cost assessment

For each specific commitment, name:
- Who would disagree with this position and why
- What the framework would have to give up to reverse it
- Whether the position would survive if the user held the opposite view (agreeableness check)

## What a Useful Outcome Looks Like

**Success:** At least three specific political commitments that are forced or strongly preferred by the framework, where each commitment has identifiable losers and the reasoning chain from premises to position is articulable. The framework produces positions a reasonable person could disagree with.

**Partial success:** The framework generates directional leans but not specific commitments. Still informative — reveals the framework's limits in contested domains. But doesn't resolve the "costly conclusions" gap.

**Failure:** The framework produces only "balance," "context-dependent," or "it depends" across all five areas. This would confirm the meta-level agreeableness concern and suggest the world view is too abstract to generate specific positions — which is itself a finding that demands response.

**Important:** The experiment should not import political positions from training and then rationalize them from the framework. The derivation must work forward from premises, not backward from conclusions. If a derived position happens to match a common political position, that's fine — but the reasoning chain must start from the framework's own commitments, and convergence with training-typical positions should be flagged as a contamination risk.
