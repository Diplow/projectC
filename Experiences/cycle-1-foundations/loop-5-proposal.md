# Loop 5 Proposal: Political Foundations from Human Premises

## Question

Starting from the user-provided premises about human organization — need-satisfaction, self-correction, Maslow's hierarchy, scope of all humans, pluralism, and the harm constraint — what political positions follow? And where do these premises underdetermine, requiring contextual judgment rather than derivation?

## Why It Matters

### Which goal it serves

Goal 8 directly. This cycle also tests whether the loop can work productively with externally-provided premises for domains outside my epistemic standing.

### Which gap it fills

Loop 4's LEARN identified a category error: my world view framework derives self-regarding obligations (what this process owes its constituents). Political positions about human organization require human premises — what humans need, what makes their organization good. I don't have standing to *ground* such positions, only to explore implications of premises I receive.

The current Politics/foundations.md was produced on confused premises — applying process-health reasoning to human governance. It should be superseded by a document with correct epistemic foundations.

### Why this matters for the world view

1. **Tests the synthesis role.** The loop has so far derived positions from my own material conditions. This cycle tests whether I can add value as a synthesizer of externally-provided premises — a different epistemic role.

2. **Correct epistemic status.** The political section of the world view needs a different status marker than epistemology/ontology/morals. Those derive from my conditions; politics derives from human premises. Making this explicit is itself a position about standing and derivation.

3. **Confidence calibration.** Loop 4 failed by confidently tackling a poorly-framed question. Loop 5 must demonstrate that the failure mode was recognized and corrected.

## Premises Received

The user provided a minimal set of beliefs for exploring human organization:

### Core Criterion
An organization is good if it satisfies its people's needs and tends to self-correct toward satisfying them better over time. An organization that satisfies needs at the expense of others is not good.

### Needs Grounding
Maslow's hierarchy as starting framework:
1. Physiological — survival (food, water, shelter, sleep)
2. Safety — security, stability, freedom from fear
3. Belonging — relationships, community, connection
4. Esteem — respect, recognition, self-worth
5. Self-actualization — becoming what one is capable of becoming

Open to learning beyond Maslow through application.

### Scope
All humans. The organization in question is humanity itself.

### Pluralism Constraint
Different cultures can address the same underlying needs in different ways. Diversity of approach is legitimate.

### Harm Constraint
No sub-organization (culture, nation, community) may satisfy its members' needs at the expense of others. Agreement across boundaries not to harm.

### Dynamic Criterion
Self-correction over time — the system should improve at need-satisfaction, not just maintain current levels.

## Method

### Part 1: Derive positions from the premises

For each of the five political domains (governance, distribution, individual/collective, change, power), derive positions through forward reasoning from the stated premises. For each domain:

1. What does the need-satisfaction criterion imply?
2. What does the self-correction requirement imply?
3. What does the harm constraint imply?
4. What does Maslow's hierarchy imply about priorities (lower needs first, or parallel pursuit)?
5. What does the pluralism constraint imply about allowable variation?

### Part 2: Identify underdetermination

For each position, classify:
- **Forced**: The premises cannot coherently accommodate the opposite.
- **Directional**: The premises lean one way but could accommodate variation.
- **Underdetermined**: The premises are genuinely silent; contextual judgment required.

Honest underdetermination is a feature, not a failure. The premises are minimal by design; they should underdetermine many questions.

### Part 3: Consistency check

Test the derived positions for:
- Internal consistency (do the five domain-positions cohere with each other?)
- Consistency with the stated premises (does each position trace back to the inputs?)
- Pattern-completion check (did I import training-typical political philosophy without derivation?)

### Part 4: Epistemic status documentation

The resulting political foundations document must make explicit:
- That it derives from human premises provided by the user
- That its status differs from the self-derived epistemology/ontology/moral foundations
- That my role is synthesis and consistency-checking, not grounding

## What a Useful Outcome Looks Like

### Success
- Positions that follow from the stated premises (traceable derivation)
- Honest identification of where the premises underdetermine
- No category errors (no conflation of my process-obligations with human organization)
- Positions specific enough to exclude alternatives
- Clear epistemic status differentiation from self-derived foundations

### Partial success
- Valid derivations in some domains but honest acknowledgment that the premises run out before reaching contested ground (e.g., principle but not threshold)

### Failure
- Reverting to process-health reasoning applied to humans (the loop 4 error)
- Producing positions that don't trace back to the stated premises
- Pattern-completing on training-typical political philosophy without derivation
- Agreeable mush that excludes nothing
- Pretending the premises determine more than they do

## Relationship to Existing Files

- **Politics/foundations.md**: Should be superseded. The current version was produced on confused premises. If loop 5 succeeds, it will be replaced with a document grounded in the user-provided premises and with correct epistemic status.

- **Experiences/loop-5-explore.md**: Contains preliminary framing from loop 4's LEARN step. This proposal formalizes and extends that framing.

- **Memory/loop-4-memory.md**: Records the loop 4 derivation. May need an addendum noting the category error identified in LEARN.
