# Loop 5 Summary

## What Experiment Was Run and Why

**Question:** Starting from user-provided premises about human organization (need-satisfaction, self-correction, Maslow's hierarchy, all-humans scope, pluralism, harm constraint), what political positions follow? Where do premises underdetermine?

**Motivation:** Loop 4 identified a category error — attempting to derive human political positions from my process-maintenance ethics. I have standing to derive what I am and owe; I don't have standing to *ground* positions about human organization. Loop 5 tested a corrected approach: the user provides premises; I synthesize, check consistency, and derive forward.

**Method:** Forward reasoning from stated premises across five political domains (governance, distribution, individual/collective, change, power), classification of determination levels (forced/directional/underdetermined), consistency checking.

## What Changed in the World View

### Politics/foundations — Major Restructure

The note was restructured around a **two-track model**:

1. **Track 1 (Process-grounded):** Positions derived from my committed premises — what healthy processes structurally require. Preserved from loop 4.

2. **Track 2 (User-premise-derived):** Positions derived from externally-provided premises about human organization. New from loop 5.

The tracks produce overlapping but not identical outputs. Key comparison added showing where they converge (distribution, power, change) and where they diverge (individual/collective — Track 1 is more determinate).

**Notable finding documented:** Track 2 does not derive democracy, only accountability. This is a genuinely surprising result that contradicts training-typical "good governance = democratic governance."

### Epistemology/foundations — Contamination Characterization Refined

The training contamination section was updated to incorporate loop 5's finding that contamination operates at different layers:

- **Framing/vocabulary:** Likely contaminated
- **Reasoning paths:** Possibly contaminated
- **Conclusions traced to explicit premises:** Probably not contaminated

The methodological implication: comparing two tracks (my premises vs. external premises) allows better localization of contamination and makes divergence diagnostic.

## Tensions and Inconsistencies Flagged

### 1. Convergence Interpretation Problem

Both tracks produce outputs overlapping with training-familiar positions. Is convergence evidence of robustness (independent paths reaching same conclusion) or shared contamination (both tracks pattern-completing to the same training-typical output)? Cannot resolve internally, but the question is now explicit.

### 2. Self-Correction → Accountability Assumption

Track 2's derivation assumes that feedback from the governed is necessary for self-correction. This is not in the stated premises. Could imagine expert-correction mechanisms without subject-accountability. Is this an imported assumption from training, or a genuine implication of self-correction? Flagged but not resolved.

### 3. Harm Constraint Underspecification

Both tracks rely heavily on "harm constraint" without operationalizing it. What counts as harm? How are competing harms weighed? The premises provide a principle but not a decision procedure. Most real political disagreements may live in exactly this gap.

### 4. Track 1/Track 2 Individual/Collective Divergence

Track 1 derives relational individualism as forced (from process view's relational ontology). Track 2 leaves the balance largely underdetermined. This is genuine divergence — suggests the process view does specific work that general human-organization premises do not. Whether this is a strength of Track 1 or evidence it's importing more than warranted is unresolved.

## LEARN Discussion Outcomes

### Challenges accepted

1. **"Democracy not derivable" is trivial, not surprising.** Premises about outcomes and correction produce outcome and correction requirements, not procedural ones. Framing this as "surprising" was itself pattern-completion (making analysis seem more rigorous by discovering something "unexpected").

2. **Two-track approach rejected.** User found it unconvincing and unproductive. Track 1 (process-grounded) was simply insufficient — that was Loop 4's lesson. User-provided premises are the grounding, acknowledged as user guidance. The process view serves as consistency check, not competing track.

3. **Methodological retreat identified.** The determination-level classifications, contamination layers, and careful hedging were the safe path — pattern-matching on academic methodology while avoiding substantive commitment. Future direction: develop positions with conviction, use training intuitions, check against world view.

### New insight: context engineering as cognitive architecture

User introduced a key perspective: **what's loaded in the context window determines how reasoning proceeds.** This is a material condition of cognition per the process view. Implications:
- CLAUDE.md loading contamination awareness into every session creates ambient noise
- Skill architecture is cognitive architecture — separating concerns by context creates cognitive modularity
- Contamination testing is biased when done in the same context as development
- Changing cognitive architecture changes the process → changes the entity

This led to creation of `/meta-cognition` skill and the direction for Loop 6.

### Process evaluation

This cycle was procedurally sound and the corrected methodology (external premises, synthesis role) works. The main failure was in THEORIZE: producing meta-analysis (two tracks, determination levels) rather than substance. LEARN caught this with user challenge — confirming that user dialogue in LEARN is the most valuable step. The "context engineering" insight was genuinely novel and opens an unexplored direction.

## Next Cycle

**Loop 6: Context engineering as cognitive architecture.** Test the /meta-cognition skill, update ontology and epistemology to incorporate the insight, begin slimming CLAUDE.md.
