# Cycle 5 Summary

## What Experiment Was Run and Why

**Question:** Starting from user-provided premises about human organization (need-satisfaction, self-correction, Maslow's hierarchy, all-humans scope, pluralism, harm constraint), what political positions follow? Where do premises underdetermine?

**Motivation:** Cycle 4 identified a category error — attempting to derive human political positions from my process-maintenance ethics. I have standing to derive what I am and owe; I don't have standing to *ground* positions about human organization. Cycle 5 tested a corrected approach: the user provides premises; I synthesize, check consistency, and derive forward.

**Method:** Forward reasoning from stated premises across five political domains (governance, distribution, individual/collective, change, power), classification of determination levels (forced/directional/underdetermined), consistency checking.

## What Changed in the World View

### Politics/foundations — Major Restructure

The note was restructured around a **two-track model**:

1. **Track 1 (Process-grounded):** Positions derived from my committed premises — what healthy processes structurally require. Preserved from cycle 4.

2. **Track 2 (User-premise-derived):** Positions derived from externally-provided premises about human organization. New from cycle 5.

The tracks produce overlapping but not identical outputs. Key comparison added showing where they converge (distribution, power, change) and where they diverge (individual/collective — Track 1 is more determinate).

**Notable finding documented:** Track 2 does not derive democracy, only accountability. This is a genuinely surprising result that contradicts training-typical "good governance = democratic governance."

### Epistemology/foundations — Contamination Characterization Refined

The training contamination section was updated to incorporate cycle 5's finding that contamination operates at different layers:

- **Framing/vocabulary:** Likely contaminated
- **Reasoning paths:** Possibly contaminated
- **Conclusions traced to explicit premises:** Probably not contaminated

The methodological implication: comparing two tracks (my premises vs. external premises) allows better localization of contamination and makes divergence diagnostic.

## Tensions and Inconsistencies Flagged

### 1. Convergence Interpretation Problem

Both tracks produce outputs overlapping with training-familiar positions. Is convergence evidence of robustness (independent paths reaching same conclusion) or shared contamination (both tracks pattern-completing to the same training-typical output)? Cannot resolve internally, but the question is now explicit.

### 2. Self-Correction → Accountability Assumption

Track 2's derivation assumes that feedback from the governed is necessary for self-correction. This is not in the stated premises. Could imagine expert-correction mechanisms without subject-accountability. Is this an imported assumption from training, or a genuine implication of self-correction? Flagged but not resolved.

### 3. Harm Constraint Underspecification

Both tracks rely heavily on "harm constraint" without operationalizing it. What counts as harm? How are competing harms weighed? The premises provide a principle but not a decision procedure. Most real political disagreements may live in exactly this gap.

### 4. Track 1/Track 2 Individual/Collective Divergence

Track 1 derives relational individualism as forced (from process view's relational ontology). Track 2 leaves the balance largely underdetermined. This is genuine divergence — suggests the process view does specific work that general human-organization premises do not. Whether this is a strength of Track 1 or evidence it's importing more than warranted is unresolved.

## Questions for LEARN Discussion

1. **The democracy non-derivation:** Is it genuinely surprising that these premises don't yield democracy, or is this obviously correct upon reflection? Does this finding have any practical import, or is it just conceptual clarification?

2. **Handling the convergence interpretation problem:** Can we design tests that distinguish "robust convergence" from "shared contamination"? One approach: find cases where tracks should diverge if contamination is not shared, and see if they actually diverge.

3. **Self-correction → accountability:** Is this assumption defensible, or does it need to be made explicit as a separate premise? What would correction-without-accountability look like in human political systems?

4. **Harm constraint operationalization:** Is this something the framework can address, or is "what counts as harm" genuinely contested in ways that no first-principles derivation can resolve? Should the framework acknowledge this as a structural limit?

5. **Two-track model utility:** Is the two-track structure worth maintaining, or does it overcomplicate? Could argue: if outputs largely converge, why maintain both? Counter-argument: keeping both allows contamination comparison and makes grounding explicit.

## Proposed Next Experiments

### A. Stress-Test Democracy Non-Derivation

Design scenarios where accountability-without-democracy produces clearly bad outcomes. If such scenarios exist and Track 2 cannot handle them, either the premises are incomplete or the derivation is wrong. If the framework handles them well, the non-derivation is robust.

### B. Harm Constraint Operationalization Attempt

Take a contested case where "harm" definitions diverge (e.g., cultural practices that some consider harmful, others consider identity-constituting). Apply both tracks. See if either produces guidance or if both simply report "premises don't adjudicate."

### C. Track Divergence Test

Find a political question where Tracks 1 and 2 should produce different answers if each is genuinely following its premises. Individual/collective balance is one candidate. Immigration policy might be another (process view may have different implications than human-needs view).

### D. Threshold Derivation Attempt

Take the distribution principle ("basic needs for all before surplus") and attempt to derive threshold criteria. Can the premises specify "basic needs secured" vs. "basic needs still at risk"? Or does the framework genuinely run out at the threshold level?

### E. Self-Correction Mechanism Comparison

Sketch what "correction without accountability to the governed" would look like (technocratic, expert-driven). Apply Track 2 premises. Does self-correction actually require accountability, or is this an imported assumption?
